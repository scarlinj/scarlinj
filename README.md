### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm @scarlinj

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on full stack web development.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other developers.

- âš¡ Fun fact: hummingbirds are the only birds that can fly backwards.

As of 2024, I took a break from web development to focus on work.  Some of my websites are hosted on Heroku, which started charging a monthly fee in 2024. I cancelled that subscription and will move my sites to Render, since these are only hobby sites.  Some sites are still on Heroku, so they may not work.  I will update those when I have time.
